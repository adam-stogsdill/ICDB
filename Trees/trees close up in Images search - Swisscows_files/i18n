No one has to accept violence and pornography appearing in the search results and in the worst case being discovered by children. Where there is a lack of parental supervision, children and youth often come across internet contents that they shouldn’t be seeing. Swisscows helps with a worldwide clean internet.

Meanwhile, however, it is clear to everyone that a comprehensive monitoring is possible through search terms, interests, the profile of the movement and the user profile created with it. This is also reported to us almost daily in the media. The question is, what can you do about it, how can you protect yourself? I do not like my data being stolen and I am firmly convinced that everyone has the right to privacy. As our team began developing the search engine, our vision was clear: to create the world\u0027s most secure search engine. Also, it should be a family-friendly search engine. Young people are now much more frequently on the Internet than adults. For this reason, we want to protect the younger generation, so there is neither violence nor pornography on Swisscows.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp class=\u0022ellipsis ellipsis-mobile-hidden\u0022\u003eOur goal is clearly defined - Swisscows remains freely accessible, free of charge and advertising. We are working tirelessly day by day, to improve and optimize our services and functions. We will continue to pursue our strategy in the future - not to save information from users and to protect our children from violence and pornography. We want to offer privacy not only as a search engine, but also in other services like WhatsApp Alternative, Map, Email, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp class=\u0022ellipsis-hidden ellipsis-mobile-hidden\u0022\u003eIn order for this work to be continued to allow an anonymous search on the Internet, Swisscows needs your support. We will use the donations for the development, technology, employees and all costs incurred around the search engine. We would like to remain an independent, secure search engine and protect our children from violent contents. If you find Swisscows useful and would like to promote our idea, take some time and help us.\u003c/p\u003e","Digest_Errors":"Errors:","News_EditorialRecommends":"Recommended by the editors","Search_NoResults":"No results found for \u0026quot;\u003cem\u003e{0}\u003c/em\u003e\u0026quot;.","Video_Link_YOUTUBE":"Get more info at YouTube","Search_Images_Size_Medium":"Medium","Search_NoResults_BackToFirstPage":"Go to the first results page","SetStartpage__Content_IE":"\u003cul\u003e\r\n                    \u003cli\u003e\u003cspan\u003e1\u003c/span\u003e Click gears on the top right.\u003c/li\u003e\r\n                    \u003cli\u003e\u003cspan\u003e2\u003c/span\u003e Select Internet Options.\u003c/li\u003e\r\n                    \u003cli\u003e\u003cspan\u003e3\u003c/span\u003e Under Home page, click Use current.\u003c/li\u003e\r\n                    \u003cli\u003e\u003cspan\u003e4\u003c/span\u003e Click OK.\u003c/li\u003e\r\n                \u003c/ul\u003e","Digest_Digest":"Digest:","Search_Images_Color_Purple":"Purple","Search_Images_Type_Clipart":"Clipart","Search_Video":"Video","SetStartpage__DragButton":"Drag this to \u003csvg class=\u0022icon\u0022\u003e\r\n\u003cuse xlink:href=\u0022/icons#home-variant\u0022 /\u003e\r\n\u003c/svg\u003e toolbar button","Search_Audio":"Music","Search_Images_Color_Orange":"Orange","Image_RemoveFromFavorites":"Remove from\u003cbr /\u003e Favorites","Digest_SwitchMode":"Switch mode","Donation_TransferringIBAN":"IBAN:\u0026nbsp;CH25\u0026nbsp;8138\u0026nbsp;0000\u0026nbsp;0082\u0026nbsp;4505\u0026nbsp;7","Russian":"Русский","Image_AddToFavorites":"Add to\u003cbr /\u003e Favorites","Wiki_MarketCapitalization":"Market capitalization","Search_Images_Type_Transparent":"Transparent","Video_SortBy_Relevance":"Relevance","Digest_SummarySize_Title":"Choose the percent of the summary size:","Search_Web_Freshness_Day":"Past Day","Search_Web_Freshness_All":"All","Translate_Not_Avaliable":"Sorry, an interpreter is not available for your region.","Search_Shopping":"Shopping","DefaultSearch_Content_Chrome":"\u003cul\u003e     \r\n                    \u003cli\u003e\u003cspan\u003e1\u003c/span\u003e Click the settings/hamburger icon ( ⋮ ) on the Chrome toolbar (top right).\u003c/li\u003e\r\n                    \u003cli\u003e\u003cspan\u003e2\u003c/span\u003e Select Settings from the drop-down menu.\u003c/li\u003e\r\n                    \u003cli\u003e\u003cspan\u003e3\u003c/span\u003e Under Search section, click Manage search engines...\u003c/li\u003e\r\n                    \u003cli\u003e\u003cspan\u003e4\u003c/span\u003e Find Swisscows in the displayed list and click Make Default.\u003c/li\u003e\r\n                \u003c/ul\u003e","Audio_Pause":"Pause","Search_Translate_For":"Translate","Error_500":"Error 500","Error_404":"Error 404","Search_Images_Size_Large":"Large","App_Script_Error":"Oops!...
